Hi there!
This is just my personal stash where I store some config files for [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)

To make use of hyprland on [MocaccinoOS](https://www.mocaccino.org/) you want to follow these steps:

Enable community-repository:
```
sudo luet install repository/mocaccino-community-stable
```
Install these packages:
```
sudo luet install layers/hyprland apps/kitty fonts/fontawesome
```
